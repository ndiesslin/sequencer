# Feature ideas for the future

- [x] add user input from interface or terminal
  - [ ] user input will be received and operated with by running the separate sequencer_player.
  - [ ] build out further
- [ ] add play and stop
- [x] any optimizations possible on the sox playback? It seems decent so far, but further research may be needed
  - [ ] profile code for any performance gains using cProfile
- [x] bass step synth using sox synth
- [ ] add ability to create patterns with multiple sequences, maybe we could have a sequences folder with different json files.
- [ ] record sequence to output
- [x] test piping entire sequence to output (completed, the problem is it adds latency doing this)
- [ ] add ability to have different sample packs
