# Feature ideas for the future

- [x] add user input from interface or terminal
  - [ ] user input will be received and operated with by running the separate sequencer_player.
  - [ ] build out further

- [ ] add play and stop
- [x] any optimizations possible on the sox playback? It seems decent so far, but further research may be needed
- [x] bass step synth using sox synth
